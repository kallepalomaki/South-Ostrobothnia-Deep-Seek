# South-Ostrobothnia-Deep-Seek

This is an experiment to run deep seek large language model fine tuning to improve translation of standard Finnish to South Osthrobothnian dialect. The experiment is based on tutorial https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/fine-tuning-deepseek-r1-reasoning-model
I ran the experiment with Google Colab with a python notebook. Fine tuning data is done in two passes firstly a bit over 300 standard Finnish and South Osthrobothnian dialect sentence pairs and second on bit over 2000 standard Finnish South Osthrobothnia word pairs. South Osthrobothnian sentences are taken from Pekka Pohjanpää's blog: http://pohopekka.blogspot.com/ I'm not sharing the sentence pairs but Standard Finnish that correspond the blog text. Blog text is indexed by sentence order so that standard Finnish sentences can be matched. I also share the vocabulary. Shared data is placeded at directory data. Not that the blog is Copyrighted material and I haven't reached copyright holder. I provide only the download function. Use at your own responsibility.
